# README

## To develop
- Ensure you have an up to date version of NPM installed
- Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run a local dev server on `localhost:1234`. This will autoupdate on changed to the source files

## To publish/push
- Run `npm run build` to build the production copies of the CSS and JS files, so that they can be run on the site
- Before making a PR, commit the results of the previous step and push with `git push origin branch_name`
- On the PR, assign appropriate users, labels, tags and milestones. Include links to any affected issues,
  which can be done by starting a line with "Closes #"; available ticket IDs will appear after the octothorpe.
