# README

- Ensure you have an up to date version of NPM installed
- Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run a local dev server on `localhost:1234`. This will autoupdate on changed to the source files
- Run `npm run build` to build the production copies of the CSS and JS files, so that they can be run on the site
- Before making a PR, ensure you have run the production build and committed the results
- Do not commit dev tempfiles to git, e.g. `/dist/product_chooser_main.1a2b3c4d.js`
